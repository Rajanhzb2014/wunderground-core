the following examples shows how to use wunderground-core api to getting
weather data from a wunderground weather station:

== Simple use a HttpDataReaderService in Java application ==

{{{

// create a instance of a wunderground data reader
HttpDataReaderService dataReader = new HttpDataReaderService();

// select a wunderground weather station (ID "INORDRHE72" = Dortmund-Mengede)
WeatherStation weatherStation = WeatherStations.ALL.get("INORDRHE72");

// set selected weather station to data reader
httpDataReaderService.setWeatherStation(weatherStation);

// get current (last) weather data set from selected station
DataSet current = httpDataReaderService.getCurrentData();

// print selected weather station ID
System.out.println(weatherStation.getStationId());

// print city, state and country of weather station
System.out.println(weatherStation.getCity() + " " + weatherStation.getState() + " " + weatherStation.getCountry());

// print datetime of measure and temperature ...
System.out.println(current.getDateTime() + " " + current.getTemperature());

}}}

== Find out all weather stations of a country by using WeatherStationService ==

{{{
// create an instance of WeatherStationService
WeatherStationService weatherStationService = new WeatherStationService();

// find all weather stations
List<WeatherStation> stations = weatherStationService.findAllWeatherStationsByCountry("Germany");

// iterate over all founded weather stations and write some information to stdout
for (WeatherStation weatherStation : stations) {
    System.out.println(weatherStation.getStationId() + "\t" + "\t" + weatherStation.getCity() + "\t" + weatherStation.getCountry());		
}
}}}
